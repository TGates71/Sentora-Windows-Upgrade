1) Using phpMyAdmin or your favorite database tool, login as ROOT user and make a backup of the zpanel_core database.

2) Create a new database: SQL query: CREATE DATABASE sentora_core;

3) Move/Rename all database tables to the new database:

***NOTICE***: If you have any custom modules that use the zpanel_core database, you will need to reinstall them or rename them using the example query below:
			  Ex: RENAME TABLE zpanel_core.table-name TO sentora_core.table_name;
SQL Query:

RENAME TABLE
	zpanel_core.x_accounts TO sentora_core.x_accounts,
	zpanel_core.x_aliases TO sentora_core.x_aliases,
	zpanel_core.x_bandwidth TO sentora_core.x_bandwidth,
	zpanel_core.x_cronjobs TO sentora_core.x_cronjobs,
	zpanel_core.x_distlists TO sentora_core.x_distlists,
	zpanel_core.x_distlistusers TO sentora_core.x_distlistusers,
	zpanel_core.x_dns TO sentora_core.x_dns,
	zpanel_core.x_dns_create TO sentora_core.x_dns_create,
	zpanel_core.x_faqs TO sentora_core.x_faqs,
	zpanel_core.x_forwarders TO sentora_core.x_forwarders,
	zpanel_core.x_ftpaccounts TO sentora_core.x_ftpaccounts,
	zpanel_core.x_groups TO sentora_core.x_groups,
	zpanel_core.x_htaccess TO sentora_core.x_htaccess,

	zpanel_core.x_htpasswd_user TO sentora_core.x_htpasswd_user,
	zpanel_core.x_logs TO sentora_core.x_logs,
	zpanel_core.x_mailboxes TO sentora_core.x_mailboxes,
	zpanel_core.x_modcats TO sentora_core.x_modcats,
	zpanel_core.x_modules TO sentora_core.x_modules,
	zpanel_core.x_mysql_databases TO sentora_core.x_mysql_databases,
	zpanel_core.x_mysql_dbmap TO sentora_core.x_mysql_dbmap,
	zpanel_core.x_mysql_users TO sentora_core.x_mysql_users,
	zpanel_core.x_packages TO sentora_core.x_packages,
	zpanel_core.x_permissions TO sentora_core.x_permissions,
	zpanel_core.x_profiles TO sentora_core.x_profiles,

4) OPEN: c:/zpanel/panel/cnf/db.php and REPLACE zpanel_core with sentora_core and SAVE. (Sentora Config)

5) OPEN: c:/zpanel/panel/etc/apps/phpmyadmin/??? and REPLACE zpanel_core with sentora_core and SAVE. (phpMyAdmin Config)

???6) OPEN: c:/zpanel/panel/etc/apps/webmail/config/db.inc.php and REPLACE zpanel_roundcube with sentora_roundcube and SAVE. (RoundCube Config)
